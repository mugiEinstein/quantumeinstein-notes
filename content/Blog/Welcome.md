# Welcome to QuantumEinstein Notes

This site is a public notebook for my research, learning, and writing.

I created it for a simple reason: **good thinking deserves a stable place to live**.

Most of what I work on involves long-term accumulation — reading papers, testing ideas, writing proofs, revisiting definitions, comparing frameworks, and gradually turning vague intuitions into structured understanding.  
A personal knowledge base is the most natural medium for this kind of work.

This website is not intended to be polished in the style of a blog.  
Instead, it is designed to be **accurate, traceable, and continuously evolving**.

## 1. What you will find here

The content on this site is organized into a few categories:

- **Notes**: technical notes, definitions, derivations, and summaries  
- **Research**: research directions, experiments, paper-related work, and project logs  
- **Ideas**: incomplete thoughts, future plans, open questions, and speculative sketches  
- **Blog**: longer-form essays, structured writeups, and reflections

I will keep the writing style concise and research-oriented whenever possible.  
When a topic is exploratory, I will label it as such.

## 2. Why I keep a public notebook

I believe that publishing research notes is valuable even when the notes are incomplete.

There are at least three reasons:

1. **Research is incremental.**  
   Many ideas only become clear after repeated rewriting.

2. **Knowledge is compositional.**  
   A good note is reusable: it can support future writing, teaching, or implementation.

3. **Public thinking is a form of discipline.**  
   It forces clarity, and it makes future self-correction easier.

This site is therefore both a record and a tool:  
a record of what I learned, and a tool to improve how I learn.

## 3. Research directions

My primary research interest lies in **Quantum Information Science**, including but not limited to:

- quantum computation and quantum algorithms  
- quantum information theory and related mathematical structures  
- quantum algorithms for **information security and cryptographic applications**  
- interdisciplinary directions at the intersection of **quantum computing and AI**

In parallel, I also work on topics in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, especially those related to:

- reasoning and representation  
- learning systems and evaluation  
- practical research workflows and tool-assisted research

From my academic background in **Information Management and Information Systems**, I am also interested in:

- information systems design  
- system robustness and **system resilience**  
- complex systems and long-term maintainability

Finally, I maintain a long-term interest in **mathematical physics**, both as a research tool and as an intellectual foundation for rigorous thinking.

## 4. What I value in research

I care about research that is:

- **rigorous** (clear assumptions, clear definitions, reproducible reasoning)
- **structural** (not only results, but why the results must be true)
- **useful** (connected to problems that matter, including security and systems)
- **accumulative** (work that builds a foundation, not isolated fragments)

In many areas of modern research, the gap between *conceptual clarity* and *implementation reality* is growing.  
I am interested in closing that gap.

## 5. How this site is built

This site is built using **Quartz**, and deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.

I prefer this workflow because it keeps everything:

- plain-text and version-controlled
- easy to maintain long-term
- portable across tools and platforms

In the future, I may extend this site into a more interactive research environment, including:

- executable math / code snippets  
- structured datasets and benchmark logs  
- interactive demonstrations of algorithms

## 6. A small note on writing

Everything here is a work in progress.

Some pages will be short, some will be incomplete, and some will be rewritten many times.  
That is expected.

If you find an error or want to discuss a topic, feel free to reach out.

## 7. Closing

If this site is useful to you, I am glad.

If not, it is still useful to me —  
because it is part of how I think.

Welcome.
