What you will find here\nThe content on this site is organized into a few categories:\n\nNotes: technical notes, definitions, derivations, and summaries\nResearch: research directions, experiments, paper-related work, and project logs\nIdeas: incomplete thoughts, future plans, open questions, and speculative sketches\nBlog: longer-form essays, structured writeups, and reflections\n\nI will keep the writing style concise and research-oriented whenever possible.\nWhen a topic is exploratory, I will label it as such.\n\n2. Why I keep a public notebook\nI believe that publishing research notes is valuable even when the notes are incomplete.\nThere are at least three reasons:\n\n\nResearch is incremental.\nMany ideas only become clear after repeated rewriting.\n\n\nKnowledge is compositional.\nA good note is reusable: it can support future writing, teaching, or implementation.\n\n\nPublic thinking is a form of discipline.\nIt forces clarity, and it makes future self-correction easier.\n\n\nThis site is therefore both a record and a tool:\na record of what I learned, and a tool to improve how I learn.\n\n3. Research directions\nMy primary research interest lies in Quantum Information Science, including but not limited to:\n\nquantum computation and quantum algorithms\nquantum information theory and related mathematical structures\nquantum algorithms for information security and cryptographic applications\ninterdisciplinary directions at the intersection of quantum computing and AI\n\nIn parallel, I also work on topics in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, especially those related to:\n\nreasoning and representation\nlearning systems and evaluation\npractical research workflows and tool-assisted research\n\nFrom my academic background in Information Management and Information Systems, I am also interested in:\n\ninformation systems design\nsystem robustness and system resilience\ncomplex systems and long-term maintainability\n\nFinally, I maintain a long-term interest in mathematical physics, both as a research tool and as an intellectual foundation for rigorous thinking.\n\n4. What I value in research\nI care about research that is:\n\nrigorous (clear assumptions, clear definitions, reproducible reasoning)\nstructural (not only results, but why the results must be true)\nuseful (connected to problems that matter, including security and systems)\naccumulative (work that builds a foundation, not isolated fragments)\n\nIn many areas of modern research, the gap between conceptual clarity and implementation reality is growing.\nI am interested in closing that gap.\n\n5. How this site is built\nThis site is built using Quartz, and deployed on Cloudflare Pages.\nI prefer this workflow because it keeps everything:\n\nplain-text and version-controlled\neasy to maintain long-term\nportable across tools and platforms\n\nIn the future, I may extend this site into a more interactive research environment, including:\n\nexecutable math / code snippets\nstructured datasets and benchmark logs\ninteractive demonstrations of algorithms\n\n\n6. A small note on writing\nEverything here is a work in progress.\nSome pages will be short, some will be incomplete, and some will be rewritten many times.\nThat is expected.\nIf you find an error or want to discuss a topic, feel free to reach out.\n\n7. Closing\nIf this site is useful to you, I am glad.\nIf not, it is still useful to me —\nbecause it is part of how I think.\nWelcome."},"Ideas":{"slug":"Ideas","filePath":"Ideas.md","title":"Ideas","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Ideas\n这里放各种灵感、碎片、未来计划。"},"Notes":{"slug":"Notes","filePath":"Notes.md","title":"Notes","links":["Research","Ideas","Blog"],"tags":[],"content":"Notes\n这里是我的笔记总入口。\n\nResearch\nIdeas\nBlog\n"},"Research":{"slug":"Research","filePath":"Research.md","title":"Research","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Research\n科研相关的笔记入口。\n\n论文阅读\n实验记录\n写作草稿\n"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"QuantumEinstein Notes","links":["Notes","Research","Ideas","Blog","Hello-Quartz"],"tags":[],"content":"欢迎来到我的公开笔记站 👋\n这里记录我在 研究 / 学习 / 写作 中的沉淀。\n\n📌 导航\n\nNotes：我的知识库主目录\nResearch：科研相关记录（论文/实验/想法）\nIdeas：灵感碎片 &amp; 未来计划\nBlog：更完整的文章\n\n\n✨ 推荐阅读\n\nHello Quartz\n\n\n🔍 使用说明\n左侧有目录（Explorer），右上角有 Graph View（知识图谱）。\n你也可以直接搜索关键词。"}}
